This layout provides a clean, modern, and intuitive user experience for the Spoonacular-based recipe app.

For the **Eat Well, Live Well** app, let’s define the modules you’ll need and outline their responsibilities. I’ll also specify which modules depend on others to ensure a modular and maintainable structure without cyclic dependencies.

---

### **Module Structure for Eat Well, Live Well**

1. **App Module (`app`)**
  - **Purpose**: The entry point for the application, initializes dependency injection, sets up navigation, and includes the main activity.
  - **Dependencies**: Depends on `core`, `feature` modules (e.g., `feature/recipe_search`, `feature/recipe_details`, `feature/favorites`, `feature/profile`).
  - **Implementation**: This module serves as the orchestrator, pulling in other feature modules and handling navigation setup.

2. **Core Module (`core`)**
  - **Purpose**: Contains shared utilities, constants, error handling, and any cross-cutting concerns or resources (e.g., theme styles, custom extensions).
  - **Dependencies**: No dependencies.
  - **Implementation**: Provides resources that can be accessed by all other modules.

3. **Network Module (`network`)**
  - **Purpose**: Manages all API interactions with the Spoonacular API, including defining Retrofit and Ktor services, response models, and error handling.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`
  - **Implementation**: Provides API services to the `data` module, encapsulating network-specific details like endpoint URLs and response serialization.

4. **Data Module (`data`)**
  - **Purpose**: Acts as the main data layer, managing repositories, handling data retrieval, and coordinating between local storage and network data sources.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`, `network`, `storage`
  - **Implementation**: Provides repositories for interacting with both network and local data, exposing them to the `domain` module.

5. **Domain Module (`domain`)**
  - **Purpose**: Contains business logic, use cases, and interfaces, serving as the core logic layer that operates independently of specific data sources or UI components.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`
  - **Implementation**: Offers use cases and clean interfaces, allowing the UI layer to interact with the data layer without needing direct dependencies on `network` or `storage`.

6. **Storage Module (`storage`)**
  - **Purpose**: Manages local data storage, including Room database setup, DAOs, and Proto Data Store for storing user preferences.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`
  - **Implementation**: Exposes data persistence functionalities to the `data` module, handling local data operations independently of network operations.

7. **Common UI Module (`common-ui`)**
  - **Purpose**: Contains shared UI components, themes, and reusable composable functions.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`, Jetpack Compose
  - **Implementation**: Provides UI components that are reusable across feature modules, such as buttons, text styles, and generic UI elements.

8. **Feature Modules**
  - Each feature module contains its own UI layer, ViewModels, and feature-specific logic.

   #### **a. Recipe Search Module (`feature/recipe_search`)**
  - **Purpose**: Handles recipe search and filtering based on user preferences and dietary restrictions.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`, `domain`, `common-ui`
  - **Implementation**: Fetches and displays recipes from the `domain` layer, with ViewModel handling interactions and managing search parameters.

   #### **b. Recipe Details Module (`feature/recipe_details`)**
  - **Purpose**: Displays detailed recipe information, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional data.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`, `domain`, `common-ui`
  - **Implementation**: Interacts with the `domain` layer to fetch full recipe details and displays them within a composable screen.

   #### **c. Favorites Module (`feature/favorites`)**
  - **Purpose**: Allows users to save, view, and remove favorite recipes.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`, `domain`, `common-ui`
  - **Implementation**: Provides a list of saved recipes from the `domain` layer, with UI controls for managing favorites.

   #### **d. Profile Module (`feature/profile`)**
  - **Purpose**: Allows users to set dietary preferences, manage account details, and configure app settings.
  - **Dependencies**: `core`, `domain`, `common-ui`
  - **Implementation**: Stores and retrieves user settings/preferences through the `domain` layer, updating the UI to reflect any changes.

### **Module Dependencies Summary**

- **App** depends on `core`, `feature/recipe_search`, `feature/recipe_details`, `feature/favorites`, and `feature/profile`.
- **Core** has no dependencies.
- **Network** depends on `core`.
- **Data** depends on `core`, `network`, and `storage`.
- **Domain** depends on `core`.
- **Storage** depends on `core`.
- **Common UI** depends on `core`.
- **Feature Modules** (e.g., `recipe_search`, `recipe_details`, `favorites`, `profile`) depend on `core`, `domain`, and `common-ui`.

Ah, my apologies for the misunderstanding! Yes, initializing Room in the **`storage` module** is the standard and recommended approach. Let's reiterate the module placement and interactions with this correction:

**Module Placement and Interactions:**

1.  **`network` Module:**
  * Contains your Retrofit setup (`NetworkModule`, `SpoonaclularApiInterface`).
  * Solely responsible for handling network API calls.
  * Returns raw data models (`SearchRecipeResponse`, `RecipeDetailsResponse`) to the `data` module.

2.  **`storage` Module:**
  * Contains your Room database definition.
  * Contains your Data Access Objects (DAOs) for interacting with the database (e.g., `RecipeDao`).
  * Contains your local data entities (Room entities).
  * Handles all local data persistence logic.

3.  **`data` Module (`RecipeRepository`):**
  * **Depends on the `network` module** to make API calls using `SpoonaclularApiInterface`.
  * **Depends on the `storage` module** to interact with the local Room database via the DAOs.
  * Contains the `RecipeRepository`. The repository will:
    * Use the `SpoonaclularApiInterface` to fetch data from the network.
    * Use the DAOs from the `storage` module to read and write data to the local database.
    * Implement logic for data sourcing, including:
      * Deciding when to fetch from the network and when to use cached data from the local database.
      * Defining caching strategies.
      * Potentially transforming data between network models and local database entities.
    * Exposes the data to the `domain` module (or directly to the `features` module if you skip the domain layer for simple cases) as `Flow<NetworkResult<...>>`.

4.  **`domain` Module (Use Cases):**
  * Contains your use case classes.
  * **Depends on the `data` module** and interacts with the `RecipeRepository` to get data.
  * Encapsulates specific business logic related to data retrieval and manipulation (e.g., fetching popular recipes, searching with specific filters).
  * Returns data (often as `Flow<NetworkResult<...>>` or domain-specific models) to the ViewModels.

5.  **`features` Module (ViewModels):**
  * **Depends on the `domain` module** and uses the use case classes to fetch and process data for the UI.
  * Prepares data for the UI (often transforming domain models into UI-specific view states).
  * Exposes `LiveData` or `StateFlow` of UI states to the UI.

6.  **`app` Module (UI - Activities/Fragments):**
  * **Depends on the `features` module** and observes the `LiveData` or `StateFlow` from the ViewModels to update the UI.

7.  **`core` Module:**
  * Contains fundamental, reusable components and utilities used across different modules (e.g., your `NetworkResult` sealed class, base classes, extensions).
  * Should have no dependencies on feature-specific modules.

**Revised Dependency Flow (with Room in `storage`):**

```
app (depends on) -> features
features (depends on) -> domain
domain (depends on) -> data
data (depends on) -> network, storage
network (no direct dependencies on data or higher)
storage (no direct dependencies on data or higher)
core (no direct dependencies on other feature modules)
```

**In summary, with Room correctly placed in the `storage` module:**

* The **`data` module** is still the correct location for your `RecipeRepository`.
* The `RecipeRepository` will orchestrate data fetching from the `network` module (for remote data) and the `storage` module (for local data via Room).
* This setup maintains a clear separation of concerns and allows for a well-structured and maintainable application.
